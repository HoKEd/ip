= Gherkin

Fast Gherkin lexer and parser based on Ragel. Gherkin is two things:

* The language that has evolved out of the Cucumber project.
* This library

== Running RSpec and Cucumber tests

rake clean spec cucumber

== Release process

* Run "rake clean spec cucumber" for each platform (1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9, jruby) to make sure all is green.
* rvm 1.8.7
* Bump version in the VERSION file
* rake clean jar compile
* rake gemspec
* git commit -a -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
* rake release
* ./nativegems.sh
* gem push pkg/... (for each native gem)

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Run rake ragel:rb to generate all the I18N lexers
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with Rakefile, VERSION, or History.txt.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
